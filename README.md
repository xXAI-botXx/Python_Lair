### Tools

- Python
- PyQt5

### Future

- In Future i could improve some things, how input and output
- And maybe i should use the ast and there features more
- Currently the GUI isn't flexible for resizing, which should be fixed
- Furthermore some code-highlitings improvements should be done for the performance
